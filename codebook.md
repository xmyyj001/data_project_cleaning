## Description

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

## original dataset 
The original dataset can be found at 
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The original dataset included the following data files:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': List of class labels and their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'test/subject_test.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

## Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

 - Subject: the integer subject ID.
 
 - Activity: the string activity name:
  - Walking
  - Walking Upstairs
  - Walking Downstairs
  - Sitting
  - Standing
  - Laying

## Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
